# Business Unit Field (bunit)

!!! info "To update the `bunit` field modify the `SentinelOne Devices Lookup - Gen` saved search. It is recommended to clone the default search before making changes (see [Clone Saved Search](../best-practice/clone-search))."

The bunit field uses standard fields from SentinelOne data. Most will find that the default configuration for this field will work for their needs. See [Asset Mappings](/reference/asset-mapping) for description of the default fields used.
