# Asset Merge

It may be possible that your devices share a common mac address or another key field that is causing an erroneous merge of your assets. If SentinelOne is your only data source for assets, you can disable asset merge in the global settings.

1. In Enterprise Security navigate to Configure > Data Enrichment > Asset and Identity Management > Global Settings.
1. Toggle off "Assets" under `Enable Merge for Assets or Identities`.
